    <h3>What Is Pasta Fagioli?</h3>
    <p>Pasta fagioli (or pasta e fagioli), which means "pasta and beans," is a traditional Italian soup. It consists of small noodles (such as ditalini or macaroni) and cannellini beans in a seasoned tomato broth.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Make Pasta Fagioli</h3>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    
    <h4>Pasta Fagioli Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This pasta fagioli recipe starts with cooking an onion in olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> You'll need an onion, celery, and a can of cannellini beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> The flavorful soup is seasoned with fresh garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Broth:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/171/soups-stews-and-chili/broth-and-stocks/">chicken broth</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> You'll need fresh chopped tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce.</li>

    <h4>Best Pasta Fagioli Tips</h4>
    <p>"This entire recipe is cheaper than one bowl at Olive Garden," culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) says of this pasta fagioli recipe. Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making a perfect pot of Italian soup every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Though the recipe calls for one can of chicken broth, Nicole uses more because she prefers her pasta fagioli a little more soupy.</li>
        <li>Many pasta fagioli recipes call for Italian sausage. You can add the meat if you like, but this top-rated recipe is pretty hearty as-is.</li>
        <li>To serve, Nicole likes to ladle the soup into bowls and top with freshly grated Parmesan, cracked black pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What to Serve With Pasta Fagioli</h3>
    <p>Since this is a hearty pasta soup, there's really no need to pair pasta fagioli with any side dishes. However, a complementary side salad or a slice of crusty garlic bread will take this impressive dish over the top.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Store Pasta Fagioli</h3>
    <p>Store your (completely cooled) leftover pasta e fagioli in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. We don't recommend freezing this soup, as the pasta will likely become unpleasantly mushy during the thawing process.</p>
