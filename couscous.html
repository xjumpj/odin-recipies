<p>6 Reviews</p>
<p>This recipe is made with mutton and chicken, but you can easily change the meats for lamb and/or merguez. I make this often and my family loves it!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Â¼ cup olive oil, or more as needed, divided</li>
  <li>8 mutton chops, fat removed</li>
  <li>4 chicken drumsticks</li>
  <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
  <li>Water to cover</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons ground turmeric</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons ground coriander</li>
  <li>3 potatoes, cut into chunks</li>
  <li>3 turnips, cut into chunks</li>
  <li>3 carrots, sliced lengthwise and cut into chunks</li>
  <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons ras el hanout</li>
  <li>1 (7 ounce) can chickpeas, drained</li>
  <li>2 zucchini, sliced lengthwise and cut into chunks</li>
  <li>5 sprigs cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h3>Couscous:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 cups water</li>
  <li>2 cups couscous</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons harissa</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season mutton chops and chicken drumsticks with salt and pepper; cook in batches with onions in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate.</li>
  <li>Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release browned bits. Return mutton chops and chicken to the pot. Pour in enough water to cover; add turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir potatoes, turnips, and carrots into the pot. Simmer, covered, until vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and ras el hanout; cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chickpeas, zucchini, and cilantro; continue cooking, covered, until zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in couscous and butter. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Transfer to a serving dish.</li>
  <li>Ladle 2 scoops of cooking liquid into a bowl; mix in harissa until smooth.</li>
  <li>Scoop vegetables onto a serving plate. Scoop mutton and chicken onto a separate plate. Serve alongside couscous, harissa sauce, and remaining cooking liquid in the pot.</li>
